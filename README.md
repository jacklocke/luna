### Configuration

Rename **config.dist.json** in **config.json**

Edit **config.json**:
- set your language (for weekdays and months)
- edit _links_ JSON with your own URLs manually or with ./edit/index.html form

_You can also add a language in "lang" folder._


---

### Editor

![preview](img/editor.png)

You can also edit _config.json_ file with the editor.

If PHP is enabled, it can also save the configuration file.

If, for security, you don't want editor, just delete **edit** folder.
